"""Low-level per-file opener + its background-process wrapper.

Deliberately TensorFlow-free (unlike FileOpenerCTAO.py, which also defines
SimTelTFDataset and therefore imports tensorflow at module level). That
matters here specifically: AsyncFileOpenerProcess spawns a NEW child every
time the interleave window in SimTelTFDataset opens another file -- i.e.
repeatedly, throughout a run, long after the parent process has already
initialized TensorFlow/CUDA (model built, GPU context up, background threads
running). Forking at that point (Python's multiprocessing default on Linux)
duplicates the parent's memory including whatever a TF/CUDA-internal thread
happened to be holding at that exact instant; only the calling thread
survives the fork, so a lock inherited as "held" by a now-nonexistent thread
can never be released -> the child (or the parent, whose own threading state
the fork operation can also disturb) hangs forever in some unrelated-looking
C call, immune to SIGTERM. Observed in practice: a stats_tdscan.py run stuck
with every worker blocked in `futex_wait_queue`, confirmed via `py-spy dump`
to be hanging in `AsyncFileOpenerProcess.close()`'s `self._proc.join()`.

The fix is to spawn (not fork) these workers, which starts each one from a
clean interpreter that never inherits the parent's TF/CUDA state. The reason
this class lives in its own module rather than just switching the context in
FileOpenerCTAO.py: spawn re-imports whatever module defines the target
function in the new interpreter, and that module is `import tensorflow`-free
here, so re-importing it (to resolve `AsyncFileOpenerProcess._producer`) only
pulls in numpy/h5py/ctapipe -- not a second full TensorFlow+CUDA init per
file. Splitting it out keeps the fix (no hang) from costing a full TF import
per spawned worker (which would otherwise partly undo it -- files get opened
repeatedly over a run, so that cost is paid over and over).
