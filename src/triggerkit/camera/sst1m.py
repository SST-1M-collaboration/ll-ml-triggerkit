"""SST-1M (DigiCam) trigger tables, built from the official camera_config.cfg.

camera_config.cfg (shipped next to this module, same file as in sst1mpipe,
digicam and CTS) gives, for each of the 1296 pixels, its position, its patch
(patch_sw_id) and the 7 patches of the patch7 cluster of that patch. All the
tables used by the trigger stages are derived from it, in the same order as
the ConfigFile_SST1M/*.csv files they replace:

* pixel_positions():   (1296, 2) pixel positions, CSV units (cm, camera rotated by 90 deg)
* patch_triplets():    (432, 3) pixels of each patch, increasing pixel id
* patch7_clusters():   patches of the patch7 cluster of each patch, itself first
* patch_positions():   (432, 2) position of each patch = its first pixel
* tdscan_neighbors(e): TDSCAN neighbourhood of radius e, one slot per hexagon cell
* board_patches(b):    patches seen by trigger board b (own + overlap), see BOARDS
